          🙏 Acknowledgement

          I would like to express my appreciation to a friend who generously provided temporary access to their Microsoft Fabric environment, so I could complete the               hands‑on components of this DataChallenge.

          Their support made it possible for me to practice real Fabric workloads and complete the Microsoft Learn exercises included in this repository.

          Please note:

          Some screenshots and PySpark outputs may display their username as part of the Fabric workspace environment.

          This reflects the environment in which the exercises were completed.
