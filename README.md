          🙏 Acknowledgement

          I want to express my appreciation to a friend who generously provided temporary access to their Microsoft Fabric environment, 
          allowing me to complete the hands-on components of this Data Challenge.

          Their support made it possible for me to practice real Fabric workloads and complete the Microsoft Learn exercises included in this repository.

          Please note:

          Some screenshots and PySpark outputs may display their username as part of the Fabric workspace environment.

          This reflects the environment in which the exercises were completed.
